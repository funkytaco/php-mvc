# Nimbus Framework Refactoring

## Overview
The Nimbus-specific functionality has been refactored from the monolithic `ApplicationTasks.php` into a class-based structure under `src/Nimbus/`.

## New Class Structure

### Core Classes
- **`Nimbus\Core\BaseTask`** - Base class with common utilities (ANSI formatting, asset copying, etc.)

### Task Classes
- **`Nimbus\Tasks\CreateTask`** - Handles app creation:
  - `nimbusCreate()`
  - `nimbusCreateWithEda()`
  - `nimbusCreateEdaKeycloak()`

- **`Nimbus\Tasks\ContainerTask`** - Manages container operations:
  - `nimbusUp()`
  - `nimbusDown()`
  - `nimbusStatus()`

- **`Nimbus\Tasks\InstallTask`** - Handles installation:
  - `nimbusInstall()`
  - `nimbusList()`

- **`Nimbus\Tasks\FeatureTask`** - Manages feature additions:
  - `nimbusAddEda()`
  - `nimbusAddKeycloak()`
  - `nimbusAddEdaKeycloak()`

### UI Classes
- **`Nimbus\UI\InteractiveHelper`** - Handles all UI/display functionality:
  - Interactive next steps
  - Configuration previews
  - Keycloak credential display
  - App status formatting

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Created base task class with common utilities
- ✅ Extracted app creation functionality
- ✅ Extracted container management functionality
- ✅ Extracted installation functionality
- ✅ Extracted feature management functionality
- ✅ Extracted UI/display helpers
- ✅ Updated ApplicationTasks.php to delegate to new classes

### Still in ApplicationTasks.php
The following functionality remains in ApplicationTasks.php (can be refactored in future iterations):
- Delete operations (`nimbusDelete`)
- Vault operations (`nimbusVault*`)
- Alias operations (`nimbusAlias*`)
- Legacy installers (`InstallMvc`, `InstallSemanticUi`, etc.)
- Helper methods (`interactiveNextSteps`, `showConfigurationPreview`, etc.)

## Benefits of Refactoring
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each class has a single responsibility
2. **Maintainability** - Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
3. **Testability** - Classes can be unit tested independently
4. **Reusability** - Classes can be used outside of Composer scripts
5. **Extensibility** - New features can be added without modifying ApplicationTasks.php

## Usage
ApplicationTasks.php now acts as a thin delegation layer, instantiating the appropriate task class and calling its methods. This maintains backward compatibility while providing the benefits of the new structure.

## Next Steps
Future refactoring could include:
1. Creating `DeleteTask` for deletion operations
2. Moving vault operations to enhanced `VaultTask`
3. Creating `AliasTask` for alias management
4. Creating `LegacyInstallTask` for old installers
5. Removing redundant helper methods from ApplicationTasks.php
