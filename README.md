# Nimbus Framework

A containerized PHP MVC application generator with Event-Driven Automation (EDA) support. Nimbus replaces manual development workflows with automated app creation, container orchestration, and optional Ansible EDA integration.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new app with EDA
composer nimbus:create-with-eda my-app

# Install and start the app
composer nimbus:install my-app
composer nimbus:up my-app

# Your app is running at http://localhost:8XXX (auto-assigned port)
```

Build Status - Active Development

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Install legacy MVC template (optional)
composer install-mvc

# Install LKUI template (for SSL certificate management)
composer install-lkui
```

## Nimbus Commands

### App Lifecycle Management
```bash
# Create basic app
composer nimbus:create my-app

# Create app with EDA enabled
composer nimbus:create-with-eda my-app

# Add EDA to existing app
composer nimbus:add-eda my-app

# Install app (copy files and generate containers)
composer nimbus:install my-app

# List all apps with status
composer nimbus:list
```

### Container Management
```bash
# Start apps (interactive mode)
composer nimbus:up

# Start specific app
composer nimbus:up my-app

# Stop apps (interactive mode)
composer nimbus:down

# Stop specific app with cleanup options
composer nimbus:down my-app
```

## Nimbus Architecture

### What You Get
Each Nimbus app generates a complete containerized stack:

**Standard App (2 containers):**
- **app-name-app**: PHP 8.2 + Apache application server
- **app-name-postgres**: PostgreSQL 14 database with health checks

**EDA-Enabled App (3 containers):**
- **app-name-app**: PHP 8.2 + Apache application server  
- **app-name-postgres**: PostgreSQL 14 database
- **app-name-eda**: Ansible EDA server with webhook listener on port 5000

### Features
- âœ… **Zero Configuration**: Apps work out-of-the-box
- âœ… **Automatic Port Assignment**: No port conflicts between apps
- âœ… **Health Monitoring**: Container status and health checks
- âœ… **Live Development**: Files mounted for immediate changes
- âœ… **Database Integration**: Schema loading with sample data
- âœ… **EDA Automation**: Event-driven Ansible playbooks
- âœ… **Template System**: Extensible app templates

### App Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ app.nimbus.json       # App configuration

```

## Legacy Usage
To run a development server for legacy templates:
```bash
composer serve
```

## Legacy Development (Pre-Nimbus) ##
### 1) Create your own View ###
- add a template view in **app/Views/** by default, this is a [Mustache]() template. (It is possible to change the rendering engine).
    - add a controller in src/Controllers/ which uses the view.
    - add a route in **app/CustomRoutes.php** that uses the controller.

    For further templating information, [mustache.php] has a good primer on how to pass in your data. If you don't like Mustache, then [No Framework Templating], explains how to replace the "Renderer".

### 2) Create your own Controller ###
- add a controller in **app/Controllers/** [(Example Controller)](https://gist.github.com/funkytaco/87fd34b5ef863ebbc120)
    - For the controller to be used, it must be used by a route in  **app/Routes.php**
    - Reference a view to load in the controller function, if applicable.
    - `$this->data` is how your model data will be accessed by the controller, and shared with the view.


### 3) Create your own Model ###
 - You can put your model in **app/Traits/** or **app/Models** for models which will not be re-used.
    - The **$conn PDO** connection is be passed into the controller.
 - The PDOWrapper class `uses` the namespace of your Trait file, e.g.,
`use \Main\Traits\MyQueryData`. Since this class is now loaded in the class all of its functions are available to the parent class.
- e.g. `getUsers()` in our traits file is accessible as `$conn->getUsers()`.

    ####To use a MySQL/Postgres/Other Database:####
- In `src/Traits/QueryData.php`
    - add your query functions in  (I will explain how to use these functions in your view)
    - uncomment `$conn = $injector->make('\Main\PDO');` . It must stay below the `$injector->define` for PDO.
- In your controller:
    -  **use \Main\PDO;** and comment/remove **use \Main\Mock\PDO;**
- In `Config.php`:
    - `$dbtype` should be set to *mysql* or *postgres*
    - You can add other types supported by PDO, as this is just a PDO instantiation.
- Stub out your database queries:
    - create a Foo_Module.php in **src/Modules** and include it like the example Date_Module class.

## Components

Components
  - [Bootstrap] for front-end development (in bootstrap branch)
  - [Composer] for dependency management and project setup (i.e. post installation script events)
  - [whoops] for error handling
  - [Klein.php] for routing
  - [mustache.php] for templating
  - [Auryn] for IoC dependency injection

Change out these components for others (i.e. replace [mustache.php] with [handlebars.php]) by reading through [No Framework] for PHP.
